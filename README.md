## Problem Statement:
X Education, an online education company catering to industry professionals, attracts numerous individuals daily who express interest in their courses by visiting their website.

The company promotes its courses across various online platforms, including search engines like Google. Upon landing on the website, visitors may explore available courses, complete course inquiry forms, or view instructional videos. When visitors provide their contact information, such as email addresses or phone numbers, they are categorized as leads. Additionally, X Education also receives leads through referrals. Once these leads are acquired, the sales team initiates contact through calls, emails, and other communication methods, resulting in the conversion of some leads while many remain unconverted. The typical lead conversion rate for X Education stands at approximately 30%.

Despite generating a substantial number of leads, X Education faces a significant challenge with its lead conversion rate. For instance, out of 100 leads acquired in a day, only about 30 convert. To enhance the efficiency of this process, the company seeks to identify the most promising leads, often referred to as 'Hot Leads.' The aim is to improve the lead conversion rate by focusing the sales team's efforts on communicating with potential leads rather than reaching out to every lead indiscriminately.

In this process, a large number of leads enter the initial stage, but only a select few emerge as paying customers at the bottom. During the middle stage, nurturing potential leads through education and consistent communication becomes crucial to achieving a higher lead conversion rate.

X Education has enlisted your assistance in identifying the most promising leads, those with the highest likelihood of becoming paying customers. The company requires you to construct a model for assigning lead scores to each lead, where higher lead scores indicate a greater likelihood of conversion, while lower scores imply a lower conversion probability. The CEO has set an approximate target lead conversion rate of 80% to guide this endeavor.

## Goals of the Case Study
The objectives for this case study encompass several key points:

1. Develop a logistic regression model capable of assigning a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each lead. This score will serve as a valuable tool for the company in pinpointing potential leads. A higher score will indicate a "hot" lead, signifying a high likelihood of conversion, while a lower score will suggest a "cold" lead with a lower probability of conversion.

2. The model should be adaptable to accommodate additional challenges or changes in the company's requirements that may arise in the future. These potential issues are outlined in a separate document. Your task is to address these challenges using the logistic regression model you create initially. Furthermore, ensure that these adaptations are integrated into your final presentation, where you will present recommendations.
